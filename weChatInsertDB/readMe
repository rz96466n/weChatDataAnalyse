This Package mainly import all your contract info into MYSQL DB

<--------! Package: MySQLClient  ==1.3.12-----!> do not use the newest version of MySQLClient

The newest version did not interact with python3.6 very good

<------------! MYSQL str code== utf8mb4--------!>

I set str code == utf8mb4, and make sure you restart your mysql after run the dbconnection.

* utf8mb4 == 'UTF-8', !='UTF8'. There are huge differents between'UTF-8' and 'UTF8'.

SQL info is inside 'wechatdb.sql'

Enjoy!
